# Benne

Benne is an open-source typeface designed and developed by [Post Studio](https://poststudio.net) with finaincial support from Google and consulting by Erin Mclaughlin. It is a text font with an intended context of text rich documents of medium/long lengths. As it was designed to harmonise with the Latin font EB Garamond (originally designed by Georg Duffner), it works well in multiscript environments.
